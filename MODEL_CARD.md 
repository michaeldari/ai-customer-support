This refined `MODEL_CARD.md` combines your existing technical details with production-grade "Responsible AI" documentation. It is designed to demonstrate to reviewers that you understand both the **mechanics** of your model and the **ethical risks** of deploying it.

# Model Card: AcmeDesk Support Copilot

## 1. Model Details

* **Version**: 1.0.0
* **Type**: Hybrid System
* **Triage**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorization.
* **Response**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings and GPT-3.5 Turbo.


* **Task**: Multiclass Ticket Classification (Category/Priority) + Grounded Support Response Generation.
* **Language**: English.

## 2. Intended Use

* **Primary Use**: Automated triage of incoming customer support tickets to reduce agent response time (MTTA).
* **Primary Users**: AcmeDesk Support Operations and Tier 1 Support Agents.
* **Out-of-Scope**:
* Processing financial transactions or sensitive billing data.
* Providing legal or medical advice.
* Handling non-English support queries.



## 3. Training & Data

* **Triage Training Set**: `tickets_train.csv` (Synthetic, ~300 entries).
* **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Local Markdown documentation (`kb_docs/`) containing product FAQs and troubleshooting steps.
* **Preprocessing**: Text lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, and TF-IDF feature extraction.

## 4. Performance & Evaluation

* **Triage Metrics**: 1.0 F1 Score on Categories (Note: Reflects distinct keyword patterns in synthetic data; real-world performance will likely decrease with natural language variability).
* **RAG Groundedness**: **0.76 (Raw)**. This indicates that while the model stays grounded in the KB, it correctly refuses to answer out-of-scope queries (e.g., "Dark Mode") where no documentation exists.

## 5. Risks, Bias, and Limitations

* **Synthetic Overfitting**: The triage model is highly tuned to specific synthetic keywords (e.g., "API," "Login"). It may fail on slang, typos, or highly descriptive but low-keyword-density tickets.
* **Silent Triage Errors**: If a high-priority issue (P0) lacks "emergency" trigger words, the model may default to P2, potentially delaying critical system outages.
* **Hallucinations**: While strictly grounded, the LLM may struggle if the Knowledge Base contains contradictory information.

## 6. Security & Mitigation Strategy

* **Adversarial Defense**: Mandatory refusal logic for prompt injection ("Ignore previous instructions") and out-of-scope requests (jokes, recipes).
* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Any triage prediction with a confidence score `< 0.60` is automatically flagged for mandatory human review.
* **PII Guarding**: (Planned) Integration of Microsoft Presidio to scrub customer data before LLM processing.
