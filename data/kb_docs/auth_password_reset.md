# Authentication: Password reset

If a user isn't receiving reset emails:
- Confirm the email is correct and check spam/quarantine
- Ask IT to allowlist: `no-reply@acmedesk.example`
- Resend from **Admin → Users → Send reset**

If still failing, collect:
- affected email(s)
- timestamp of reset attempt
- any mail gateway logs
